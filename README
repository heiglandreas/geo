This Module contains Classes to handle Geolocation-Data

The main Part is the Point-Class that references any Point by 
Latitude/Longitude.

Multiple points can be combined to a Polygon and multiple Polygons can be 
combined to a Shape.

Such a Polygon or a Shape has a bounding box defined as a Rectangle.

Thats it.

Nothing more.

Oh, and you can convert such a Shape (or multiple shapes if you want) to an SVG
via Shape::render() by providing an instance of the Svg-Renderer.
