#Org\Heigl\Geo - Manual

## Introduction

\Org\Heigl\Geo is a package to parse coordinates and create graphical
representations from them.

I mainly created the package in the first place to read a file I obtained
from OpenStreetmap.org and create an SVG-file from it.

## Installation

You should install this package using [composer](https://getcomposer.org).

    composer require org_heigl/geo


## Documentation

There is also an [API-Documentation](http://heiglandreas.github.io/geo/api) and
you can have a look at the latest [Code-Coverage](http://coveralls.io/)
